                                <p>Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the sense of
                                    historical pictures from before the invention of the motorcar. Other things
                                    that are different at the moment will be queues to get into stores and the
                                    lines marked out on the floor to show how far apart we should be.</p>
